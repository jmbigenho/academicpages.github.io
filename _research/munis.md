excerpt: 'With Grant Johnson. We characterize how municipal governments respond to economic
fluctuations, using employment shocks to capture cyclical
movements. We pay particular attention to the role that local
fiscal institutions---specifically, Tax and Expenditure
Limitations (TELs) on growth in general expenditures or
revenues---play in the observed response. We find that in response
to a positive employment growth shock of one percent,
municipalities facing these limits persistently lag behind their
unconstrained counterparts in capital-intensive spending growth,
while there is little differential effect on public safety and
administrative expenditures. Significant effects on capital
outlays persist for two years following a shock, reaching a peak
relative reduction in growth of approximately 3.5\% per-capita
after one year. Transportation and public maintenance spending, in
particular, track this pattern and reach maximum relative
reductions in growth of roughly 1.7\% and 1.5\% the year following
a shock, respectively, indicating they are absorbing the brunt of
the capital response. Relative growth in the total size of
government following a shock, however, is only modestly
affected. Our findings illuminate a likely unintended consequence
of fiscal responsibility measures in U.S. cities: limits designed
to restrain the size of government may instead alter the
government's spending mix, inducing investment cuts that allow a
government to maintain its patterns of administrative and public
safety spending.'

Abstract: We characterize how municipal governments respond to economic
fluctuations, using employment shocks to capture cyclical
movements. We pay particular attention to the role that local
fiscal institutions---specifically, Tax and Expenditure
Limitations (TELs) on growth in general expenditures or
revenues---play in the observed response. We find that in response
to a positive employment growth shock of one percent,
municipalities facing these limits persistently lag behind their
unconstrained counterparts in capital-intensive spending growth,
while there is little differential effect on public safety and
administrative expenditures. Significant effects on capital
outlays persist for two years following a shock, reaching a peak
relative reduction in growth of approximately 3.5\% per-capita
after one year. Transportation and public maintenance spending, in
particular, track this pattern and reach maximum relative
reductions in growth of roughly 1.7\% and 1.5\% the year following
a shock, respectively, indicating they are absorbing the brunt of
the capital response. Relative growth in the total size of
government following a shock, however, is only modestly
affected. Our findings illuminate a likely unintended consequence
of fiscal responsibility measures in U.S. cities: limits designed
to restrain the size of government may instead alter the
government's spending mix, inducing investment cuts that allow a
government to maintain its patterns of administrative and public
safety spending.
