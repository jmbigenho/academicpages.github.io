of this coming from previous donors to the district.'

Abstract:     I estimate the causal effect of
candidates' election
results on the future contribution behavior of their
donors using a regression discontinuity
design. I find that individuals contributing to narrowly-winning
House candidates are nearly 10 percentage points more likely to
contribute to a House candidate in the following cycle than contributors to
narrowly-losing candidates. Further, these effects persist for up to three cycles following the
close election. I show that much of this effect is due to
a discontinuity in future giving to the same candidate. An
analysis of contributors to Senate candidates corroborates these findings. Descriptive analysis
suggests that individuals are more likely
to make future contributions when their candidate runs again,
regardless of whether they won or lost, calling into question a ``reinforcement
learning'' hypothesis that underlies behavioral theories of
political participation. This has implications for the incumbency
advantage, as incumbents can rely more on contributions from past donors to

from narrowly-winning parties receive \$130K more in
individual contributions than those from narrowly-losing parties in the
following cycle, almost all
of this coming from previous donors to the district.
