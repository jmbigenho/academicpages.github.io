Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at
the University of California, San Diego. I will finish my PhD in
June 2018. Upon completion, I will be joining Amazon.com as an
Economist.

My research interests include labor economics, political economy and
behavioral economics.
